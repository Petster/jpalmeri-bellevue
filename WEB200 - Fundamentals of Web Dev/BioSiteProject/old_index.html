                                Josh Golan is a young adult from Ohio, who has just recently turned 18 years old. Josh comes from an Italian, Polish, and Russian heritage, and has been learning to speak German for a few years, with hopes to travel around Europe and Asia. Josh’s favorite color is Purple and prefers a darker purple. When asked what he likes to do in his downtime, he said “...I like to either do something relaxing, like streaming, or playing some video games with my friends online”. Josh loves to stay online on his computer and wants to go to college to learn Graphic design to one day become a Graphic designer.

                                Josh has many hobbies that he enjoys doing, when asked what sort of hobbies he has, he replied: “I like to play video games at a high skill level, I also enjoy producing music and editing videos. I’ve always had an interest in creating art so I like to paint as well”. Josh’s notable favorite games include Overwatch, OSU, and Team Fortress 2. Wanting to know more I asked Josh what got him into video games and he told me “I was a young and casual tf2 player who didn't know much about first person shooters. But I instantly fell in love with the team based clash shooter genre. And ever since those days I've been interested in following and joining Esports teams”.

                                Like many teenagers and young adults that grew up using computers, Josh also enjoys creating videos, and producing music, Josh said “I love when these two passions combine, and I can edit things that have music and use my knowledge of both, to produce high quality videos” You can see some of Josh’s work on youtube. I finally asked Josh about his painting hobby, and he told me “I’ve always been interested in learning to draw realistically, but it’s never been something that I could grasp. So I looked into painting and had an easier time understanding the concepts. And while I still wasn't able to paint realistically, I felt it was a lot easier and was a much more relaxing artistic outlet.”
